# Welcome to SAT->Start
A work in progress educational tool built to help visualize various SAT solving algorithms. This work was done as a part of a senior project. The precursor to this portion of the project can be found here: [SAT_SeniorProject](https://github.com/fisherlyon/SAT_SeniorProject).

## Running
Clone the repository and open either of the two index.html files---located in DFS_SAT or CDCL_SAT---in your favorite internet browser to run the corresponding visualization tool.<br><br>
For an overview of SAT solving, what I did during the first quarter of senior project, as well as an in-depth explanation of how DFS-SAT and CDCL-SAT work via the use of this visualization tool, view the senior project write-up file!
